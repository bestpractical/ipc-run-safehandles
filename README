NAME
    IPC::Run::SafeHandles - Use IPC::Run and IPC::Run3 safely

SYNOPSIS
        use IPC::Run::SafeHandles;

DESCRIPTION
    IPC::Run and IPC::Run3 are both very upset when you try to use them
    under environments where you have STDOUT and/or STDERR tied to something
    else, such as under fastcgi.

    The module adds safe-guarding code when you call IPC::Run or IPC::Run3
    under such environment to make sure it always works.

    If you intend to release your code to work under normal envionrment as
    well as under fastcgi, simply use this module *after* the "IPC" modules
    are loaded in your code.
